# Liver-Disease-Prediction

#### Goal: To develop a POC using Flask, HTML and CSS for predicting whether a person is suffering from Liver Disease or not, implementing Machine Learning algorithm.

### About the Data set: 
This is a machine learning project where we will predict whether a person is suffering from a Liver Disease or not. The data set was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records). 
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

Columns:

1. Age of the patient
2. Gender of the patient
3. Total Bilirubin
4. Direct Bilirubin
5. Alkaline Phosphotase
6. Alamine Aminotransferase
7. Aspartate Aminotransferase
8. Total Protiens
9. Albumin
10. Albumin and Globulin Ratio
11. Dataset: field used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease, or no disease)

A binary classification problem statement.

### Project Description: 
After loading the dataset("indian_liver_patient.csv") the first step was to perform an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA).
Count plos for the target was made to check whether the dataset is balanced or not. It was a balanced dataset. Factor plots were created for the features "Age , "Gender", "Dataset"(target). Histograms
and scatter plots were also a part of EDA. Distribution of data and correlation distribution was understood. Then a correlation heatmap was plotted to check the correlation between all the independent features.
Jointplot was made for "Total_Protiens" and "Albumin".

The second step was to perform Feature Engneering. Missing values of the feature "Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio" was handled by replacing it by mean. Label Encoding was performed on "Gender", where 1 denotes male and 0 denotes female. Any other nan values was replaced with 0.94 (from domain knowledge).
The dataset was divided into independent(X) and dependent(y) features.

The third step was Feature Selection. Features were selected manually based on domain knowledge.
'Total_Bilirubin', 'Direct_Bilirubin', 'Alkaline_Phosphotase', 'Alamine_Aminotransferase', 'Total_Protiens', 'Albumin', 'Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio'were the features that got selected.

The Forth step was Model Building. The dataset was divided into indepenent and dependen features. Train test split was performed for getting the train and test datasets.
Random Forest Classifier was applied on the training data after testing with other Machine Learning algorithmns.
Predicton and validaion was performed on the test dataset.

The fifth step was to perform Hyperparameter Optimization on our model. RandomizedSearchCV was used after setting a list of parameters. The model with the best parameters was then fitted on the train and test data. Best model was validated using accuracy score, confusion matrix and classification report.
False positives and false negaives were reduced. 

The final step was to save the model as a pickle file to reuse it again for the Deployment purpose. Joblib was used to dump the model at the desired location.

The "Liver Disease Prediction.ipynb" file contains all these informations.

### Deployment Architecture: 
The model was deployed locally (port 5000). The backend part of the application was made using Flask and for the frotend part HTML and CSS was used.
I have not focussed much on the frontend as I am not that good at it. The file "app.py" contains the entire flask code and inside the templates folder, "liver.html" contains the homepage and "result.html" contains the result page. 

### Installation:
The Code is written in Python 3.7.3 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:

##### 1. First create a virtual environment by using this command:
```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.7
```
##### 2. Activate the environment using the below command:
```bash
conda activate myenv
```
##### 3. Then install all the packages by using the following command
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
##### 4. Then, in cmd or Anaconda prompt write the following code:
```bash
python app.py
```
##### Make sure to change the directory to the root folder.
